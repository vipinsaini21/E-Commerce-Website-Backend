### Product Management 

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for product information, ensuring granular control for admins.

### User Management

- Secure user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities. Admins can manage user roles and access details.

### Order Management

- User-friendly order creation and retrieval, along with comprehensive order management capabilities for admins (view all orders, update order status, and deletion).

### Review Management

- User review creation and retrieval, with an option for admins to delete inappropriate reviews.

### Cloudinary Management

- Integrated Cloudinary for seamless cloud storage and image management, enhancing scalability and performance.
